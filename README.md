## Introduction

**BuildSystem** is a simple but powerful - as the name already says - system for builders, with lots
of great features for everyday usage. Manage worlds in the worlds navigator, change their permission, projects and
status with ease. And not to forget: let each player decide which settings whey think are best for them and now the
building can start!

## Features

* **100% customisable messages** and scoreboard
* Powerful navigator which allows for an overview of all worlds. Extra GUIs for:
    - **_Not Started_**, **_In Progress_**, **_Almost Finished_** and **_Finished_** maps
    - Maps that have been put to the **_Archive_**
  - **_Private_** player maps: Each player can create their own map, if a map with their name
    doesn't exist
* **Create worlds with ease**: When creating a world, choose from:
    - **_Predefined worlds_** _or_
    - **_Custom generators_** provided by 3rd party plugins _or_
    - **_Custom templates_** which you can add yourself
* Easily **manage your worlds**: Choose from over 6 different statuses for each world
* When in worlds that are set as finished, the player is invisible and can fly in adventure mode, so
  they can only have
  a look without breaking anything [bypass: `/build`]
* Set the **permission** you need to join a worlds
* Change what project each world is for (e.g. `"A small BedWars map"`)
* Set the **world item**, so you can spot them faster amongst other worlds
    - You can choose from all items that are available in Minecraft
* **Import**, **delete** and **create worlds** with ease
* New and improved navigator!
    - Not a GUI anymore, but furthermore an interactive navigator
    - But if you rather have a "normal" GUI, the option is there for you to toggle between the
* **Per player settings**
* **Building tools**:
    - Toggle block physics
    - Custom speed
    - Receive player skulls
    - Change the time in a world with only a single command
    - Toggle double slab breaking
    - No-Clip
    - Open iron doors and iron trapdoors
    - Night vision
    - Disable interactions with certain blocks

## Contributing

### To compile...

#### On Windows

1. Shift + right-click the folder with the directory’s files and click "Open command prompt".
2. `gradlew clean build`

#### On Linux, BSD, or Mac OS X

1. In your terminal, navigate to the folder with directory’s files (cd /folder/of/buildsystem/files)
2. `./gradlew clean build`

### Then you will find...

* the **BuildSystem** plugin jar `BuildSystem-<identifier>` in **buildsystem-core/build/libs**

### Other commands

* `gradlew idea` will generate an [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) module for each
  folder.
* `gradlew eclipse` will generate an [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) project for each
  folder. _(Possibly broken!)_
