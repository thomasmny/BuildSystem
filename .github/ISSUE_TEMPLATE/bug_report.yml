        **Before You Start:**

        This form is for submitting bug reports. If you have a usage question
        or are unsure if this is really a bug, make sure to:

        - Ask on our [Discord Chat](https://discord.com/invite/rduPF3yk62)

        Also try to search for your issue - it may have already been answered or even fixed in a development branch.
        However, if you find that an old, closed issue still persists in the latest version,
        you should open a new issue using the form below instead of commenting on the old issue.
